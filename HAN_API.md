# Octopus Home Pro Home Area Network (HAN) API

## Introduction

The Octave OS running on the main Home Pro device as a system, provides RESTful
APIs for getting energy consumption data inside the Octopus Home Pro SDK and
other parts of the system. This document explains how to access these APIs from
within the SDK and what fields are exposed.

## The HAN API Endpoint

In order to access any RESTful API, the most basic part of the connection
mechanism is knowing the endpoint that hosts the API or say responds to it. For
the HAN API to be accessed from the SDK the main system exposes an environment
variable **HAN_API_HOST** into the SDK environment.

For any python based applications, it can simply be retrieved as follows

```
import os

han_host = os.getenv('HAN_API_HOST')
```

## APIs

This section discusses the RESTful APIs that are available over the HAN API
endpoint, how these are invoked and elucidates the output.

These APIs are generally applicable to both electric and gas meters with a few
exceptions that are noted in relevant sections, if found.

### Meter Status

The meter status API `get_meter_status` can be used to fetch the status as
implied by the name. The following example demonstrates how it is used

```
import os
import requests

han_host = os.getenv('HAN_API_HOST')
meter_type = "elec"

# Call the get_meter_status API
response = requests.post(han_host + "/get_meter_status", json={"meter_type": meter_type})
if response.ok:
    meter_status = response.json()["meter_status"]
    print("Meter status for {} meter: {}".format(meter_type, meter_status))
else:
    print("Error calling get_meter_status API: {}".format(response.json()["Status"]))
```

this outputs data similar to

```
Meter status for elec meter: {
        "time": 1713535438,
        "status":       {
                "type": "elec",
                "mstatus":      0,
                "aconsumindicate":      0,
                "lastupdated":  766850639
        }
}
```

meter stype. For **electricity** meters, the representation is

### Meter Info

The meter info API `get_meter_info` can be used to fetch basic meter information
as implied by the name. The following example demonstrates how it is used

```
import os
import requests

han_host = os.getenv('HAN_API_HOST')
meter_type = "elec"

# Call the get_meter_info API
response = requests.post(han_host + "/get_meter_info", json={"meter_type": meter_type})
if response.ok:
    meter_info = response.json()["meter_info"]
    print("Meter info for {} meter: {}".format(meter_type, meter_info))
else:
    print("Error calling get_meter_info API: {}".format(response.json()["Status"]))
```

this outputs data similar to

```
Meter info for elec meter: {
        "time": 1713538882,
        "minfo":        {
                "type": "elec",

                "siteid":       "xxxxxx",
                "RSSI": -63
        }
}
```

### Meter Consumption

The meter consumption API `get_meter_consumption` can be used to gather consumption
data. The following example demonstrates how it is used

```
import os
import requests

han_host = os.getenv('HAN_API_HOST')
meter_type = "elec"

# Call the get_meter_consumption API
response = requests.post(han_host + "/get_meter_consumption", json={"meter_type": meter_type})
if response.ok:
    meter_consumption = response.json()["meter_consump"]
    print("Meter consumption for {} meter: {}".format(meter_type, meter_consumption))
else:
    print("Error calling get_meter_consumption API: {}".format(response.json()["Status"]))
```

this outputs data similar to

```
Meter consumption for elec meter: {
        "time": 1713539551,
        "consum":       {
                "type": "elec",
